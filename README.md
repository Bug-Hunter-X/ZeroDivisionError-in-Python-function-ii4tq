This repository contains a simple Python function that demonstrates a common runtime error: ZeroDivisionError. The bug.py file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.py provides a corrected version with proper error handling. The error occurs when the function attempts to divide by zero, a mathematically undefined operation. The solution introduces a try-except block to gracefully handle this situation, preventing the program from crashing and providing informative error messages.
